Description:  Embed Brainf*ck in your perl code
 Brainf*ck (yes, there is a u there.) is about the tiniest Turing-complete 
 programming language you can get.  A language is Turing-complete if it can 
 model the operations of a Turing machine--an abstract model of a computer 
 defined by the British mathematician Alan Turing in 1936.  A Turing machine 
 consists only of an endless sequence of memory cells and a pointer to one 
 particular memory cell.  Yet it is theoretically capable of performing any
 computation.  This module will allow you to mix Brainf*ck with your
 perl code.
