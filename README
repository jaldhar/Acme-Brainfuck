Acme::Brainfuck version 0.9.0
==============================

Brainfuck is about the tiniest Turing-complete programming language you
can get.  A language is Turing-complete if it can model the operations of
a Turing machine--an abstract model of a computer defined by the British
mathematician Alan Turing in 1936.  A Turing machine consists only of an
endless sequence of memory cells and a pointer to one particular memory
cell.  Yet it is theoretically capable of performing any computation.  
This module will allow you to mix Brainfuck with your perl code.
