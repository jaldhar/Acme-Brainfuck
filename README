Acme::Brainfuck version 1.1.0
=============================

Brainfuck is about the tiniest Turing-complete programming language you
can get.  A language is Turing-complete if it can model the operations of
a Turing machine--an abstract model of a computer defined by the British
mathematician Alan Turing in 1936.  A Turing machine consists only of an
endless sequence of memory cells and a pointer to one particular memory
cell.  Yet it is theoretically capable of performing any computation.  
This module will allow you to mix Brainfuck with your perl code.

INSTALLATION

This module should work with any version of perl from 5.005 on up.  
However if you are using a version prior to 5.7.0, you will have to
install the Filter::Simple module and dependencies yourself.  Newer
versions include this as part of the core.

If you have the Module::Signature module installed, you can verify the 
integrity of this distribution by typing:

   cpansign -v

Then to install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

or 
   perl Build.PL
   Build
   Build test
   Build install
